# Copilot Instructions for FMC Grader Webapp

This project is a modern app for transcribing handwritten Rubik's Cube FMC solution sheets using OCR. The app allows users to upload an image of a solution sheet, automatically extracts the scramble and handwritten moves, and displays the results. It uses React for the frontend, Node.js/Express for the backend, and integrates Tesseract.js for OCR image processing.
